Spring and autumn are also good options, particularly 
the months of May and September when there is little rainfall 
and the temperatures are agreeable.Winter should be avoided: 
Severe cold in certain areas, frequent snow, fog and rain means

Christmas Markets

It's cold and dark in Germany in December, but for many Germans, it's the best time of year. 
The city of Nuremberg's "Christkindelsmarkt," or Christmas Market, is a world-renowned attraction,
featuring stalls of handmade wooden toys, Christmas angels, mulled wine and the foods that make Germany famous, including bratwurst and goulash. Other cities also have Christmas markets, but none are quite as elaborate or traditional as Nuremberg's.
If you like winter sports, the surrounding hills of the state of Bavaria will provide plenty of opportunities 
for skiing, snowshoeing and sipping mugs of warm milk in a cozy gasthaus -- the German equivalent of a bed and breakfast.

The Warm Season

Germany's weather can be relatively cold in the winter, but summer is definitely the time 
when the weather is the finest. From May to September, expect warm days with the 
possibility of an occasional rain storm. Also expect to delight in many colorful flowers 
in the quaint home gardens in the villages, as well as the vast gardens of the "Schloss," 
or castle you're almost certain to find in every larger city. With the fine weather, 
however, comes the high tourist season, so expect the prices to go up and the availability of accommodations to go down.

Oktoberfest

Oktoberfest may be the best or the worst time to visit Germany, depending on how you look at it.
 With the influx of millions of tourists hoping to take part in the world's largest beer festival, 
Munich and its surrounding environs can be really, really hectic from mid-September to mid-October. T
If you're not a fan of battling crowds of any size, your best bet is visiting Germany during the 
"shoulder seasons" from March through May and from late October through November. The weather may be a bit chilly,
 but you'll enjoy lower prices and fewer crowds. Some of the highlights of the shoulder seasons include Maifest 
in May, a May Day-like festival with colorful costumes, and Rhein in Flammen, or Rhein in Flames, 
featuring fireworks displays over many villages of the Rhein River.</pre></h2>

		<h2>TABLE MANNERS</h2>
<h2>
<pre>

Never eat with your fingers in Germany. Only bread is permitted to be broken by hand. 
Even pizza and fries are eaten with a fork, so watch out!
Place your hands on the table while eating (not the elbows).
 Moreover, don't let your hand rest on your lap while eating. 
Nevertheless, it is not that great a sin even if your hand slips to your lap.
Do not begin eating, until your host says 'guten appetit', which means good appetite or 'bon appetit',
which means enjoy your meal.
Placing your knife and fork side by side, indicates you are done with your meal. If you place them crossed,
it means you haven't finished with the meal.


                     Restaurant Etiquette

                     When dining at a posh restaurant, you need to wait to be escorted and seated. 
                     In a regular restaurant, you     can choose your table. Sharing tables is common in Germany,
                     so if you enter a restaurant and do not find a vacant    table, join somebody. 
                     However, make sure you ask them if you could do so. Moreover, don't strike a conversation with that person. 
                     He or she will not appreciate the intrusion.
                     Water has to be ordered separately and has to be paid for. Do not ask the waiter for regular tap water.
                     Germans consider this a sign of stinginess. They serve both carbonated mineral water and still water.
                     At the time of bill generation, the waiter will come to your table and ask 'all together' or 'separate'.
                     This means if you want the bill divided individually or together. 
                     This is beneficial if you are sharing a table. </pre></h2>

Greeting Etiquette

When introduced to a person, shake hands. Never give a hug. Moreover, maintain eye contact. 
It is considered impolite if you don't do so.When introduced to a group of people, wait for your host 
to introduce you, then shake hands with everybody; men, women and even children. 
Since Germans like their space, stand at an arm's distance or so from them, while conversing. 
Moreover, avoid touching them, because this is considered as an invasion of privacy.
As far as addressing people is concerned, never address people with the first name,
unless specifically asked to do so. The title Herr (for men) and Frau (for women), should be used before their last name.
While conversing in German, make sure you address the older generation by the word 'sie'.
 Only friends refer to each other as 'du'. 'Sie' signifies respect and must be used in all formal settings, while 'du' is used as an informal tone.
Don't greet people with 'how are you', unless you want to spend the next fifteen minutes listening to their personal problems. 
A 'good morning' in German, like 'guten tag' will do.

		<h1>BASIC LANGUAGE</h1>
<h2><pre>
German is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe.
It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein.
It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg.
The languages which are most similar to German are the other members 
of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English,
the Frisian languages,Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. 
German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language,
 after English.
One of the major languages of the world, German is the first language of 
about 95 million people 
worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the European Union.
German also is the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US
(after Spanish, French and American Sign Language) and third in the EU 
(after English and French; at lower secondary level),
the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the
fourth most widely used language on websites 
(after English, Russian and Japanese).
The German-speaking countries are ranked fifth 
in terms of annual publication of new books,
 with one tenth of all books (including e-books) 
in the world being published in the German language.</pre><h2>

		<h2>TIPS</h2>
<h2>
<pre>
Service and VAT are included in the menu price in restaurants, bars, etc. all over Germany.
Still, it is typical to "round up" the amount to some more-or-less round figure.
A rule of thumb is to add 5-10%, generally ending with a full Euro amount.
This is entirely voluntary in Germany and people DO NOT expect tips, but like everywhere 
they are grateful if given one. </pre></h2>

<pre>
Tipping in Germany and tipping in some other countries, such as the United States, are totally different.
In Germany, waitresses are paid more and so the tips are smaller compared to the USA.
Nevertheless, the 5-10% rule of  thumb still applies.
If you want to tip less (according to some advice on the net) be prepared to appear stingy.
Typically, the waiter/waitress always comes to you and tells you your total.
You then tell him/her how much you will pay, i.e. the amount you owe plus any "rounding up" -- 
for example, the waiter/waitress might say "€7.60;"  you hand him/her a €10 note and say "9 Euros."
S/he then will give you €1 in change.
While Germany is a leader in many areas of technology, it is decidedly not so in credit card acceptance.
When eating out, visiting any store or trying to pay for just about anything, don't be surprised if the 
response to your credit card is "Nein." 
Most Germans still settle in cash or rely on debit cards called "EC" or "electronic cash" cards which are not
logo-bearing and do not work like credit cards. While some hotels, restaurants and other venues will take credit cards, by far the majority does not. When shopping or consuming anything, it's always wise to ask in advance, otherwise you'll be expected to pay in cash. Personal checks are no longer used in Germany (having been replaced by EC cards), and Traveller's Checks often carry a substantial
"service charge" for cashing them.

		<h1>CULTURE</h1>
<h2>
<pre> Germans have made tremendous contributions to classical music,
 and the traditions of famous German or Austrian composers such as
 Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig von Beethoven, 
Johannes Brahms, Richard Wagner and Gustav Mahler live on today.
With their penchant for precision and engineering, it is not surprising
 that Germans have a strong tradition of printmaking by woodcut and engraving. 
There is also a strong representation of all phases of architecture-
 including Romanesque, Gothic, Classicist, Baroque,
 Rococo and Renaissance
 -represented in cathedrals, castles and public buildings.
 One well-known example of classic German art
 is the Brandenburg Gate,
 a former city gate that is now used
 to symbolize Berlin's unity.  </pre><h2>

Punctuality-Do not be late for even a minute. Arriving late is an insult.

Hands-in-pockets-Keep your hands out of your pocket while speaking to Germans. They consider it slovenly behavior. Keep hands by your side.

Chewing gum-Keep the gum in your pocket, where the hands used to be-ditto on slovenly behavior.

Okay sign-The American A-Okay sign, (index finger and thumb forming a circle), is an obscene gesture, (calling a German an a—hole).

Blowing nose-A German will leave the room, find a restroom or private area, and blow their nose. Honking into a handkerchief or tissue at a dinner or conference area is disturbing to Germans.

Cleaning fingernails-This is probably a global taboo, but Germans prefer you clean and file fingernails in private.

Opening windows-It may be warm. Not everyone showered that morning. Do not open a window to get a breeze. Germans fear a draft may lead to a fatal disease. You will hear ‘Es Ziet’ as soon as you touch the window.

Flower colors-Flowers are a great gift in Germany. Red is for romance. Carnations signify mourning. Lilies and chrysanthemums are for funerals. Yellow roses are safe.

First drink-Yes, you are thirsty after a long business or tourist day. As a guest, wait for the host to offer a toast before the first sip. Clink glasses or acknowledge everyone in the room. Reply by saying, ‘Prosit.’</pre></h2>
